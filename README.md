This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Project title: What categories are people's happy moments?
+ This project is conducted by Yingqiao Zhang

+ Project summary: I mainly used exploratary data analysis and topic modeling in this project. In the first part, I made many graphs to show the relationship between different variables and got reasonal conclusions. In the second part, I used LDA algorithm to assign each happy moments into a topic and got useful properties of each topic including the most frequent words, the probability each happy moments assigned to them, and the relative importance of them.
