# ADS Project 1: What made you happy today?
### Output folder

The output directory contains analysis output, processed datasets, logs, or other processed things.
+ I used two datasets to do this analysis. The first one named processed_moments and since it's too large to upload, I compressed it into a rar file. The second one is demo_data, the url of this dataset is 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritpublic/HappyDB/master/happydb/data/demographic.csv'
