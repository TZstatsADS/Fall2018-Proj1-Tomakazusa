# ADS Project 1: What made you happy today?
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.
+ I used two datasets to do this analysis. The first one named processed_moments and since it's too large to upload, I compressed it into a rar file. The second one is demo_data, the url of this dataset is 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ritpublic/HappyDB/master/happydb/data/demographic.csv'
